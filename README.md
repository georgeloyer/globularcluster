# globularcluster
Python programs for analyzing globular cluster catalog and instances.
The intention for this project is to be the repository for a variety of python libraries and scripts
that can be shared with participants in an Observing Lab called Exploring Globular Clusters
that will be presented both in-person and virtually as part of Robert Ferguson Observatory programs.
